# vscode-awslambda

Unofficial AWS Lambda extension for VS Code

I am thinking it would be neat to have similar functionality of [Microsoft/vscode-azurefunctions](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-azurefunctions) for AWS Lambda, so I will be planning on developing an extension to do such.

## Planned Features

* Create functions w/ templates
* List functions in sidebar
* Deploy functions
